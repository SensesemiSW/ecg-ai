## ECG Classification with Deep Learning - ResNet

The goal of the project is to classify ECG signals into different diagnostic classes using a 1D ResNet model.

Below are the details and attachments:

Code Files:
 - model_architecture.py
 - data_utils.py
 - train_model.py
 - test_model.py

Trained Model: trained_model.h5

Datasets: The data can be downloaded from the Physionet website : PTB-XL Dateset

Additionally, you can download the raw ECG signals from the following link: PTB-XL Raw Data

Instructions:
- Download the dataset.
- Download the code files and place them in the directory as the dataset.
- Run test_model.py to evaluate the trained model on the test data.
